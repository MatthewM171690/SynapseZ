# Synapse Z :rocket:

Welcome to Synapse Z, a project that revives the good old days of Synapse X! :boom:

Synapse Z is a revival of the now dead project Synapse X, which aims to build upon it to allow users to access its power in 2023 post-patch!

## Features :star2:

- **Anti-detect:** Synapse Z's main focus is in anti-detection by I3yfron to keep your account safe.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** We are keeping the same loved interface from Synapse X to make our software easy to use.
- **Script Forward-porting** Synapse Z allows users to use old X scripts, requiring no new code at all.
- **Regular Updates:** Stay ahead of the game with frequent updates, introducing new features and improvements to enhance your experience.

## How to Use Synapse Z? :tools:

1. **Download:** Obtain the latest version of Synapse Z from the Releases tab or above.
2. **Launch:** No install needed! Synapse Z is fully portable. Just run it and it works with little to no wait! 

## FAQ :question:

**Q: Will this be detected?**
A: Not currently, but maybe in the future.

**Q: It isnt launching, and just loads without opening a GUI.**
A: Please wait a few minutes, the program has to deobfuscate itself live to prevent detections, but the disadvantage of this is that it may take a while.

**Q: Can I use Synapse Z on any device?**
A: Synapse Z is compatible with a wide range of devices, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**Q: For free?**
A: While Synapse Z is currently free, there is no way we can keep this up forever. Please support us by clicking on the donation tab added inside of settings.

**Q: How do I report an issue or provide feedback?**
A: We welcome your feedback! Reach out to us in the ""Help"" tab added inside of settings.
